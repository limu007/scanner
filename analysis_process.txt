AcqThread

in self.prepare -> scanner.next_point
in self.acquire -> spectrac.measure
in self.process set
	self.analyse.calculate=True -> panel.analyse -> instance of Analyse
		Analyse.calculate is "Event"
		calling _calculate_fired()
	processing_job=analyse(spect) #work in background
	self.result() -> panel.result_update()

on each acq. thread is launched -> when is it collected? can it write to Wafer structure?

can it update map on ended calculation?
